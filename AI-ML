<p><h2><strong><b>You can choose from a variety of ML jobs in 2021</b></strong></h2></p>
&nbsp;

<p>Programmers and software engineers are some of the most desirable professionals of the last decade. Machine learning and AI are not exceptions. Most of the companies and institutes provide Artificial Intelligence courses Post Graduate Program <a href="https://www.edureka.co/executive-programs/machine-learning-and-ai"><u>AI ML Courses</u></a> to help you improve your skill and fast forward your career. Based on data from Indeed.com, Glassdoor.com, we conducted research to determine which professions are most popular and the skills required for each.</p>
<p><h3><strong><b>1. Engineer in machine learning software</b></strong></h3></p>
<p>A machine learning software engineer works in the area of artificial intelligence. They create algorithms that allow the machine to understand causal relationships between events and analyze input information. These algorithms are also improved by ML engineers. You will need to be able to think clearly, program well, and have good programming skills in order for you to become a ML software engineer.</p>

<p>Employers expect ML software engineers with a bachelor's degree to have at least two years of experience in the implementation of ML algorithms (can be acquired while learning). It is necessary that you can write code in at least one programming language. Flink, Spark and Sqoop are all required tools. Flume, Kafka and other relevant tools may also be necessary.</p>
<p><h3><strong><b>2. Data scientist</b></strong></h3></p>
<p>Data scientists use machine learning algorithms and data analysis to deal with large amounts of data. They often work with unstructured data sets that need to be pre processed and cleaned. Data scientists are responsible for identifying patterns in data sets that can be used to predict business intelligence. Data scientists need to have a solid mathematical background in order to be successful. They also need to be able to focus on every detail.</p>

<p>A bachelor's degree in math or physics, statistics, operations research, or math is required in order to work as a data scientist. Strong Python and SQL skills are required, as well as exceptional analytical skills. It is important that data scientists are able to present their findings. This is why it is beneficial to have some experience with data visualization tools such as Google Charts, Tableau and Grafana. Excellent communication skills and PowerPoint skills, as well as FusionCharts and js.</p>
<p><h3><strong><b>3. AIOps engineer</b></strong></h3></p>
<p>AIOps (Artificial Intelligence for IT Operations), engineers are responsible for developing and deploying machine learning algorithms to analyze IT data and improve the efficiency of IT operations. Larger businesses and middle-sized companies have to dedicate large amounts of resources for monitoring real-time performance and anomaly detection. AI software engineering can automate this process to optimize labor costs.</p>

<p>AIOps engineer is essentially an operations role. AIOps engineers need to be knowledgeable in areas such as security, cloud technologies, networking, and certifications. It is also necessary to have experience with scripts for automation (Python and Go, as well as shell scripts).</p>
<p><h3><strong><b>4. Cyber</b></strong><strong><b> S</b></strong><strong><b>ecurity analyst</b></strong></h3></p>
<p>An analyst in cybersecurity identifies security risks and potential data leakages. They implement security measures to safeguard companies from information loss and protect the confidentiality and safety of large data. Because AI systems are ubiquitous, it is crucial to protect these data from malicious usage.</p>

<p>A bachelor's degree is often required for cybersecurity specialists. They should have an understanding of security frameworks and other areas such as operating systems, networking, and software applications. Experience in security-oriented competitions such as CTFs, CASP+, and GCED are also considered.</p>
<p><h3><strong><b>5. Cloud architect for ML</b></strong></h3></p>
<p>Most ML companies prefer to store and process data in the cloud. This is because it is more reliable and scalable. This is especially true for machine learning, which requires machines to handle large amounts of data. Cloud architects manage the organization's cloud architecture. As cloud technology becomes more complex, this profession is particularly relevant. It encompasses all aspects of cloud computing architecture, including ML software platforms and servers, storage, networks, and networks.</p>

<p>Cloud architects will benefit from having experience in <a href="https://www.articleritz.com/aws-certification-cost-get-certified-on-a-budget/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AWS</a> and Azure architecture and configuration management tools such as Chef/Puppet/Ansible. It is necessary to be proficient in Python and Go programming languages. Headhunters also seek expertise in monitoring tools such as AppDynamics and Solarwinds.</p>
<p><h3><strong><b>6. Computational linguist</b></strong></h3></p>
<p>Computational linguists are involved in the development of ML algorithms as well as programs that can be used to develop online dictionaries and translating systems. They share a lot with machine learning engineers, but have deep knowledge in linguistics and an understanding of how computers approach natural language processing.</p>

<p>Many computational linguists need to know how to code in Python and other languages. Employers expect them to offer valuable advice on new approaches to NLP and product design.</p>
<p><h3><strong><b>7. Human-centered AI systems designer/researcher</b></strong></h3></p>
<p>Artificial intelligence system designers who are human-centered ensure that intelligent software is designed with the end user in mind. Deep learning algorithms and collaboration are essential for human-centered AI. The communication between humans and AI must be seamless. An AI designer who is human-centered must not only have technical knowledge, but also be able to understand cognitive science, computer sciences, psychology of communication, UX/UI design, and other related topics.</p>

<p>A human-centered AI system designer position is often research-intensive. Candidates must have, or be in the process, a PhD in human-computer interaction or another related field. Candidates must submit a portfolio that includes examples of their research in the field. They will often have at least 1+ years experience in AI and related fields.</p>
<p><h3><strong><b>8. Robotics engineer</b></strong></h3></p>
<p>Robotics engineers are those who design and build robots and other complex robotic systems. Robotics engineers need to think about how the robot will work, as well as how it would be assembled and code software. To become a specialist in this field you must be proficient in electronics and mechanics. Robots often use artificial intelligence to avoid obstacles and dynamic interaction. This will give you plenty of opportunities for working with ML systems.</p>

<p>Employers typically require that you have a bachelor's or higher degree in fields such as computer science, engineering, or robotics and experience in software development in programming languages like C++ or Python. Also, you will need to have a working knowledge of hardware interfaces such as cameras, LiDAR and embedded controllers.</p>
<p><h3><strong><b>What does a Machine Learning Professional do?</b></strong></h3></p>
<p>There are many types of machine-learning professionals. Job responsibilities can overlap depending on the organization's size. Machine learning is generally used to solve complex problems.</p>

<p>"People interested in machine learning are often problem solvers," according to U.S. News &amp; World Report. They are driven by the challenge of finding patterns others cannot see. They create tools that allow them to analyze large datasets and identify commonalities. They are interested in turning the unknown into the familiar and helping to make better decisions and achieve better results.</p>

<p>The AI professional most in demand is the machine learning engineerwhose responsibilities include managing and building platforms for ML projects. AsDiscover Data ScienceThis explains why machine learning engineers can often double as data scientists in smaller companies.</p>

<p>"The responsibilities of a machine learning engineer will be relative to the project they're working on," according to Springboard.com. However, you will notice that machine learning engineers are responsible for creating algorithms based on statistical modeling and maintaining machine learning solutions that can be scaled in production.</p>
